## Definition

Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing model where businesses reward affiliates for driving traffic or sales through promotional efforts. Affiliates promote a brand’s products or services using unique affiliate links or codes. When a user completes a purchase through that link, the affiliate earns a commission. The customer using a code may also receive a certain discount. The merchant will then pay the commission to the affiliates in a pre-agreed mode. 

Lifecycle of Affiliate Marketing:

Affiliate Recruitment: Affiliates join the program by signing up through an affiliate sign-up form or manually added by the store owner.

Promotion: Affiliates are given unique referral links or codes to promote products on their websites, blogs, or social media.

Traffic Generation: The affiliate’s audience clicks on the referral link and is redirected to the store's website.

Conversion: If the visitor makes a purchase, it is tracked through the unique affiliate link.

Commission Earned: The affiliate receives a predefined commission for the successful sale.

Payout: The business processes payouts to affiliates through preferred payment methods, often on a scheduled basis.


Affiliate marketing is a win-win strategy—affiliates earn income, and businesses gain new customers with minimal upfront investment.
